  <h2 id="terms-heading">Comprehensive Terms and Conditions for Thrive Wisp Gardening Services</h2>

  <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
  <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement between you, the client or user ("you," "your"), and Thrive Wisp Gardening Services ("we," "us," or "our"). By engaging our services or accessing our website in any capacity, you confirm and acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all provisions contained herein. We reserve the right to modify or update these Terms at any time, and your continued use of our services after modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes. Should you have any questions or require clarification, please reach out to our support team prior to using our services.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Scope of Services</h3>
  <p>Thrive Wisp Gardening offers professional gardening, landscaping, and outdoor maintenance services designed to meet the unique needs of residential and commercial clients. Our services include but are not limited to lawn care, garden design, pest control, seasonal cleanup, tree and shrub maintenance, and consultation on sustainable gardening practices.</p>
  <p>All services are subject to availability, and any specific project will be detailed in a separate service contract or agreement outlining scope, pricing, schedules, and deliverables. We endeavor to perform all services diligently and to the highest professional standards; however, outcomes involving living plants will inherently involve natural variances beyond our control.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Client Obligations and Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>As a client, you agree to provide accurate and complete information necessary for the provision of our services, including property location, access details, and any relevant conditions that may affect work (such as underground utilities, pets, or safety hazards). You ensure compliance with local laws and permit requirements regarding landscaping or other outdoor alterations.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for maintaining safe access for our personnel to perform services and agree to promptly communicate any changes or issues that could impact our work. Payment obligations as defined within your service agreement must be fulfilled timely, and you acknowledge that delays or failure to pay might impact the continuation or completion of services.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Quotes, Payment, and Pricing</h3>
  <p>All pricing provided by Thrive Wisp Gardening will be outlined in written quotations or service contracts. Prices quoted are valid for 30 days unless otherwise specified and are subject to change after that period. Prices are inclusive of labor, materials, and equipment necessary to complete services, except as otherwise stated.</p>
  <p>Payment terms will be defined in your agreement, typically requiring deposits, milestone payments, or final payment upon completion. Payment methods accepted include credit cards, bank transfers, and other methods as mutually agreed. Late payments may incur additional fees or interest charges according to applicable laws. No services will commence or continue without agreed payment arrangements.</p>
  
  <h3>5. Service Modifications, Cancellations, and Termination</h3>
  <p>You may request modifications or cancellations of services, subject to our approval and adherence to agreed notice periods. Changes may affect pricing, scheduling, or project scope and will be documented via amendments to the original agreement. We reserve the right to terminate services for non-compliance with terms, unsafe conditions, or non-payment.</p>
  <p>Refund policies vary depending on service nature and work performed, and will be explained in your service contract. In cases of termination initiated by either party, final settlements and any outstanding obligations must be resolved promptly.</p>
  
  <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>All intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos, designs, text, and images on our website and printed materials, remain the property of Thrive Wisp Gardening Services or respective third parties.
